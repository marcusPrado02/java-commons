# Commons Platform Overview

This repository provides a modular "commons platform" for building high-quality Java services.

Principles:
- Kernel is framework-free and domain-safe
- Application modules orchestrate use-cases
- Adapters implement IO and frameworks
- Starters provide batteries-included setup
